# BetterVue — Quick Start

#### You don’t want your recruiters to be like Pierre Chartrier.

BetterVue gives companies real-time visibility into how their recruiters perform during technical interviews. The platform analyzes candidates’ résumés, helps recruiters ask smarter questions, and evaluates each question’s relevance, difficulty, and coverage of key technical topics. It also ensures recruiters stay professional and aligned with company values. After each interview, BetterVue generates an AI-powered summary with a performance score, strengths, red flags, and improvement suggestions. In short, BetterVue makes interviews fairer, more consistent, and more effective for everyone.

## Quick Start

cd quantcoach-livekit/backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd quantcoach-livekit/frontend
npm install

npm run dev

## How it works

Creating a room automatically starts an agent.

The agent processes audio, sends data to LLM evaluators, and emits SSE events.

The frontend listens to the SSE stream and updates charts in real time.
