## Notes

- The credentials are **already pre-filled** in the HTML file
- You don't need the backend server for basic video calls
- This connects directly to LiveKit Cloud
- Works completely offline (except for LiveKit connection)

## Controls

Once connected:
- **Toggle Microphone** - Mute/unmute your mic
- **Toggle Camera** - Turn camera on/off
- **Leave Room** - Disconnect

## Sharing with Team

Just send them the `client-standalone.html` file. They can:
1. Open it in their browser
2. Enter the same room name
3. Join the call!

## Troubleshooting

**Camera/Mic not working?**
- Make sure you clicked "Allow" in the browser
- Try Chrome or Firefox (best compatibility)
- Check your camera/mic aren't being used by another app

**Can't see other person?**
- Make sure you both entered the **exact same room name**
- Check both people clicked "Join Room"
- Look at the status message for errors

**Video is laggy?**
- Check your internet connection
- Try closing other applications
- Reduce number of participants

That's it! No server, no setup, just open the file and go! 🚀
