# Context

This project was originally created during the Iterate Paris Hackathon (November 15–16), organized by Maki, Source & Motier, and powered by Anthropic, Lovable, ElevenLabs, Unaite, and Iterate.


The event took place at La Maison by Motier Ventures, with mentorship and jury members from leading AI organizations including Hugging Face, Anthropic, H Company, and more.

# BetterVue — Quick Start

#### You don’t want your recruiters to be like Pierre Chartrier.

BetterVue gives companies real-time visibility into how their recruiters perform during technical interviews. The platform analyzes candidates’ résumés, helps recruiters ask smarter questions, and evaluates each question’s relevance, difficulty, and coverage of key technical topics. It also ensures recruiters stay professional and aligned with company values. After each interview, BetterVue generates an AI-powered summary with a performance score, strengths, red flags, and improvement suggestions. In short, BetterVue makes interviews fairer, more consistent, and more effective for everyone.

# Quick Guide
This quick guide explains how to install, configure, and run the app in the `quantcoach-livekit` directory.

⚠️ **Never commit API keys.** Use a local `.env` or a secrets manager.

## Overview
BetterVue:
- Analyzes a candidate’s résumé and suggests questions.
- Scores each question (relevance, difficulty, coverage).
- Streams real-time indicators: difficulty bar, topic radar, tone, timeline, red flags.
- Generates an AI interview summary.

Main components in `quantcoach-livekit/`:
- **Backend:** FastAPI, agents, SSE endpoints.  
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript dashboard with live visuals.

## Requirements
- Python **3.11+**  
- Node.js **18+**  
- LiveKit instance (cloud or self-hosted)  
- API keys: OpenAI/Anthropic, ElevenLabs/Deepgram, etc.  
- Local `.env` files for secrets

## Quick Start

### Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd quantcoach-livekit/backend

python -m venv .venv

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Frontend
```bash
cd quantcoach-livekit/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How it works

Creating a room automatically starts an agent.

The agent processes audio, sends data to LLM evaluators, and emits SSE events.

The frontend listens to the SSE stream and updates charts in real time.
